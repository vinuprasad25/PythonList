                                       #CREATING LIST IN PYTHON
#Lists in Python can be created by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets[].
#Unlike Sets, list doesnâ€™t need a built-in function for creation of list.
 #Unlike Sets, list may contain mutable elements.


 #creating  List
List1 = []
print("Blank List:- ",List1)

#Adding Elements in list
List1= [10,20,30]
print("The elements present in list are:-",List1)

#Creating List of Strings and accesing by indexing
List1=['Vinu','Prasad','Python','Developer']
print(List1[1])
print(List1[2])
print(List1[3])

#crerating Mutli-Dimensional List
List1=[['Vinu','Prasad'],['Python','Developer']]
print("the mutli-dimensinal list are :-",List1)
print(List1[1])
