                                          Python Lists
-->Lists are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages.
-->Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool in Python.
-->A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects.
-->Lists are mutable, and hence, they can be altered even after their creation.
-->List in Python are ordered and have a definite count.
-->The elements in a list are indexed according to a definite sequence and the indexing of a list is done with 0 being the first index.

--> Each element in the list has its definite place in the list,
              which allows duplicating of elements in the list,
               with each element having its own distinct place and credibility.
---------------The Important Feature of List in Python---------------------------
   ---> Lists are a useful tool for preserving a sequence of data and further iterating over it.
